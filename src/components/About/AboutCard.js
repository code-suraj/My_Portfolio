            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Sai Suraj Nuthanakalva</span>, a <span className="purple">Sr. Full Stack Java Developer</span> and <span className="purple">AWS Certified Solution Architect Associate</span> with over 8 years of experience designing and developing scalable, robust web applications. I specialize in backend development with <span className="purple">Java, Spring Boot,</span> and <span className="purple">Hibernate</span>, and I create dynamic, responsive front-end interfaces using <span className="purple">React.js</span> and <span className="purple">AngularJS</span>.
            <br />
            <br />
            My expertise extends to <span className="purple">cloud technologies</span> like AWS, where I deploy and manage scalable systems using services like EC2, Lambda, and S3. I also leverage <span className="purple">DevOps tools</span> such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform to automate and streamline deployments, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
            <br />
            <br />
            Iâ€™m passionate about building microservices architectures and handling real-time data processing with <span className="purple">Apache Kafka</span> and <span className="purple">RabbitMQ</span>, as well as implementing CI/CD pipelines using <span className="purple">Jenkins</span> for efficient, automated workflows.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I'm not coding, I love exploring new technologies, continuously learning, and finding ways to improve development practices to deliver high-quality, innovative solutions.
